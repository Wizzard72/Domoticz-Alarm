Alarm system for Domoticz

There was no real alarm system for Domoticz. Some scripts and blokeys are available, but they do not meet my expectations. So I created this plugin.

This plugin creates an Alarm System in Domoticz. It depends on the devices already available in Domoticz, such as PIR, Door, etc. sensors.<br/>
        <br/>
        <h3>Configuration</h3><br/>
        <br/>
        Alarm zones:<br/>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>The first zone triggers the Security Panel</li>
            <li>The can be max 9 Alarm Zones</li>
            <li>Alarm zones are separated in Armed Home and Armed Away</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Armed Home consists of devices (idx numbers) that can be triggered while you're at home (Door sensors, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Armed Away consists of all devices (idx numbers) that can be triggered when you're not home (PIR sensors)</li>
                    <li>In Armed Away mode it includes also the Armed Home sensors</li>
                </ul>
            <li>The deviceID (idx) that belongs to a zone are separated with a "," and a zone is separated with a ";"</li>
            <li>Both parameters must have the same amount of zones, but a zone can have different amount of devices in it. When a zone has no devices put in a "0" or the text "none".</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        Open Sections are detected and reported per zone in the Arming Status Selector Switch. After 50 seconds it's armed anyway.<br/>
        <br/>
        Exit and Entry Delay can be set through the Selector Switches. They are for all the zones configured<br/>

The plugin is tested to works on a Raspberry Pi 3b.

To install the plugin login to the Raspberry Pi.
  
      cd /home/<username>/domoticz/plugin
  
      git clone https://github.com/Wizzard72/Domoticz-Alarm
      
      sudo systemctl restart domoticz.service

The plugin requires the following information:
