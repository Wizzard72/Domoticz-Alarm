Alarm System for Domoticz

There was no real alarm system for Domoticz. Some scripts and blocky's are available, but they do not meet my expectations. 
So I created this plugin.

This plugin creates an Alarm System in Domoticz. It depends on the devices already available in your Domoticz setup, 
such as PIR, Door, other sensors.
        
Configuration
        
Alarm zones:
    * The first zone triggers the Security Panel
    * The can be max 9 Alarm Zones.
    * Alarm zones are separated in Armed Home and Armed Away:
    * Armed Home consists of devices (idx numbers) that triggers the outside perimeter, such as:
        * frond and/or back door sensor(s),
        * window sensor(s),
        * PIR sensor(s) in the garden, 
        * etc.
    * Armed Away consists of all devices (idx numbers) that can be triggered when you're not home, such as:
        * PIR sensors indoors,
        * door sensor(s) indoor,
        * etc.
    If the Alarm is in Armed Away mode it includes also the Armed Home sensors.
    * The deviceID (idx) that belongs to a zone are separated with a "," and a zone is separated with a ";"
    * Both parameters must have the same amount of zones, but a zone can have different amount of devices in it. 
      When a zone has no devices put in a "0" or the text "none".
        
Open Sections are detected and reported per zone in the Arming Status Selector Switch. After 50 seconds it's armed anyway.
        
Exit and Entry Delay can be set through the Selector Switches. They apply to each configured zone.

The plugin is tested to works on a Raspberry Pi 3b.

To install the plugin login to the Raspberry Pi (SSH / Putty).
  
      cd /home/<username>/domoticz/plugin
  
      git clone https://github.com/Wizzard72/Domoticz-Alarm
      
      sudo systemctl restart domoticz.service
